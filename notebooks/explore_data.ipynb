(source) - ie this game is an entire additional country of environmental damage for ~no useful gain\\nno one has found an actual use for any of it except for online drug dealing (which requires niche coins since Bitcoin is massive distributed public ledger)\\nthe level of market manipulation and accounting fraud by eg Tether (and now USD \"coin\" admitted lying about the backing) would normally send people to jail but has for some reason got a free pass\\nthe clueless marketing by fanboys who only hope to enrich themselves by creating another layer to the pyramid\\nthe endlessly stupid projects it has spawned where blockchain is seen as a solution to anything aside from the niche case of \"distributed tamper evident journal\"\\nit has single handedly made mass international ransomware a viable business model by allowing a way to receive cash outside the banking system\\nthe general enablement of all sorts of scams, e.g. the endless kids on this very subreddit promoting \"12% crypto savings accounts\"\\nIt isn\\'t nearly as secure as people think it is. Any determined state actor could subvert the network.\\nDeflation isn\\'t actually a good thing in a currency. It ultimately favours the wealthy who can hold and dont need to spend.\\nMining (proof of stake or work) allow the wealthy to invest in mining equipment to control or dominate the market.\\nUltimately, no government on earth is going to give up its monetary policy as that is a key lever of control.\\nessentially everyone involved at this point is just trying to hustle the next generation - any hope any of it would serve as a useful technological or financial system has gone)\\nthe massive mis-represnetaion of how bitcoin in particular works, despite claims, it does not offer any of the following:\\nanonymity - the entire blockchain is public and diligently recorded on millions of nodes\\ndistributed freedom - a small number of mining cartels control almost all the hash power and normal people use one of ten crypto currency exchanges for everything anyway\\nunencumbered transactions - it\\'s comically slow and inefficient\\nconvenient purchases - wallets are unwieldly for normal people, no reversibility\\nstore of value - volatility is hilarious and all anyone cares about us BTC:USD\\nthings I do like about cryptocurrency:\\n\\nmonero is pretty clever\\nethereum smart contracts are pretty scifi\\nwatching people learn 5000 years of history of why we have banking regulation in a single decade has been fun\\nthere will be some massive financial catastrophes to watch that will mostly only harm people who did not read my previous list\\nthe earlier state of every single exchange either getting robbed or exit scamming their own fanboys was quite funny in retrospect\\n(thx to u/TwentyCharactersShor for some extra items).\\n\\nI used to just think cryptocurrency was a fun hack but a bad idea for the mainstream, but I\\'m now pretty convinced it should be banned purely on resource grounds, since it seems impossible to force the externalities to be addressed\\n\\nIt\\'s possible that someone will invent a cryptocurrency that\\'s efficient to a level that it\\'s not morally reprehensible to use, but how would it take off? the existing cryptocurrency interests want bitcoin to succeed purely because they\\'re the top of the pyramid and also selling the shovels and so now anything new has to compete aginst the real financial sector and the entrenched cryptocurrency players.'"

       "88   People don't want to accept that crypto is a seriously risky and speculative asset, arguably one of the most speculative because there is absolutely 0 metrics that set a \"floor\" on the price- there are no revenue, there is no EPS, there are no buildings or machines or IP that have a hard value- There is nothing to weigh and look at to say \"Holy fuck, this is very undervalued right now i should buy\"....the only thing propping up crypto prices is \"feels\"\\n\\nAnd all this money is coming out of the same bucket because crypto isn't a closed loop, meaning you don't get paid in crypto and transact in crypto directly, you have to buy it with fiat and when you buy something with it the vendor then has to exchange it back to fiat for it to have any real use for them because its not a medium of exchange excepton the very razors edge of the margin....\\n\\nAs the economy gets worse and prices keep going up people simply have less money, so you are going to have a lot more sellers than buyers willing to put their fiat into the riskiest of assets when they have to pay 50% more for food and gas and might lose their job soon.\\n\\nThis is what happens every downturn, people flee risky speculative assets 🤷‍♂️\\n\\nIts going to get worse, we haven't really seen any layoffs yet but it's going to happen....Crypto is really going to take a shit when that happens because, again, all the money is coming from the same bucket\\n\\nMy point is that Crypto markets will never \"decouple\" from the wider financial markets, that's a complete pipe dream imo   \n",

For a 'currency' that is primarily used for stored value, not transactions, this is incredibly problematic. Assuming there will be no transformational breakthroughs in computing efficiency, proof of work is going to be with us, and obfuscating the long term value of crypto. - https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2021/09/20/bitcoins-impacts-on-climate-and-the-environment/\\n\\nComplexity: My smart, non-techy friend literally just put 40k into Titan's crypto fund because he didn't trust himself to not make a costly error in purchasing the coins I advised him on. He's in his early 30s and works for a tech company, still not confident of transacting in the coins themselves. That's going to continue to be a problem of broad adoption.\\n\\nScammy coins: This thread loves to shit on Elizabeth Warren for trying to regulate the crypto space, I think her heart is in the right place, but often gets the details wrong - BUUUUUT if we want broad adoption, we need zero news stories of people getting rug pulled, hacked, etc. Regulation specifically around verification of project fundamentals would be incredibly valuable to giving consumers confidence in what they're purchasing, prevent people from being rug pulled and becoming a crypto detractor.\\n\\nLittle/edge case consumer utility: Self explanatory. Until there are actual broad consumer market applications we're all still rolling dice in a casino.</td>\n",

Lo an behold, I have come to realise that the \"coins\" I had for past few years are actually not there.. Imagine my surprise. I loaded $100 into my jaxx wallet a few years ago just because why not? Well thankfull it was only $100 because ofcourse I lost it. My wallet is stuck on 'initializing' whatever that means and I cant do anything: https://ibb.co/7Xv0NF1\\n\\nNever has a bank just lost my money like that. Crypto is the biggest fucking scam in the universe. Get out of it while you still can.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\n\\nOk so winzupdatee showed me how to fix my crap assbitcoin and as promised, I sent him 0.001btc as well as my fav answer from previous post dispite not being convinced. So to whoever said I wasnt going to pay up, I forgive you.\\n\\nALSO, this experience has only reinforced my distrust of crypto. I paid almost TEN DOLLARS to transfer like 40. THATS A 25% FEE LOL. How the hell can anyone advocate for a service that takes more fees than private lender banks for interest? Yea I get it, you can anonymously send money anywhere instantly, but apart from this dumb excercise on reddit, I cant fathom any reason or use for this especially not a \"store of value\".

For a 'currency' that is primarily used for stored value, not transactions, this is incredibly problematic. Assuming there will be no transformational breakthroughs in computing efficiency, proof of work is going to be with us, and obfuscating the long term value of crypto. - https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2021/09/20/bitcoins-impacts-on-climate-and-the-environment/\\n\\nComplexity: My smart, non-techy friend literally just put 40k into Titan's crypto fund because he didn't trust himself to not make a costly error in purchasing the coins I advised him on. He's in his early 30s and works for a tech company, still not confident of transacting in the coins themselves. That's going to continue to be a problem of broad adoption.\\n\\nScammy coins: This thread loves to shit on Elizabeth Warren for trying to regulate the crypto space, I think her heart is in the right place, but often gets the details wrong - BUUUUUT if we want broad adoption, we need zero news stories of people getting rug pulled, hacked, etc. Regulation specifically around verification of project fundamentals would be incredibly valuable to giving consumers confidence in what they're purchasing, prevent people from being rug pulled and becoming a crypto detractor.\\n\\nLittle/edge case consumer utility: Self explanatory. Until there are actual broad consumer market applications we're all still rolling dice in a casino.   \n",

Lo an behold, I have come to realise that the \"coins\" I had for past few years are actually not there.. Imagine my surprise. I loaded $100 into my jaxx wallet a few years ago just because why not? Well thankfull it was only $100 because ofcourse I lost it. My wallet is stuck on 'initializing' whatever that means and I cant do anything: https://ibb.co/7Xv0NF1\\n\\nNever has a bank just lost my money like that. Crypto is the biggest fucking scam in the universe. Get out of it while you still can.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\n\\nOk so winzupdatee showed me how to fix my crap assbitcoin and as promised, I sent him 0.001btc as well as my fav answer from previous post dispite not being convinced. So to whoever said I wasnt going to pay up, I forgive you.\\n\\nALSO, this experience has only reinforced my distrust of crypto. I paid almost TEN DOLLARS to transfer like 40. THATS A 25% FEE LOL. How the hell can anyone advocate for a service that takes more fees than private lender banks for interest? Yea I get it, you can anonymously send money anywhere instantly, but apart from this dumb excercise on reddit, I cant fathom any reason or use for this especially not a \"store of value\". All civil and polite discussions are appreciated.   \n",
