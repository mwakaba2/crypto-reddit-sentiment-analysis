Dig a hole in the ground? Most people keep it on centralised exchanges anyway. What if you die, it won't go to your relatives?\\n\\nIt fucks with your mental and emotional state too, because of the unstable nature of it. One day you think you have money, the next day 20% is gone. People who buy early are basicly just taking other peoples investment when they sell. Call it pyramid games. The space is flooding with scammers, annoying shilling shouting idiots and and what not.\\n\\nBitcoin and the likes are highly energy inefficient. Yes but look at the regular financial systems energy use you will say, blah blah....this is like saying u can dump your plastic in the river because there's a plastic soup already in the ocean. Yes here and there they use solar panels...well why not use them for more usefull things as they are costly to make. Yes but proof of stake you will say, yes...it's basicly being kept in the air by people that are again....gambling with their money. All these company's, can't they just build stuff without thousands of people throwing their money at them, hoping they will get rich temselves.\\n\\nBlockchains are cool in their decentralised way, but all the speculation on top of it...\\n\\nWhile everyone is shouting at digital coins, society remains a shithole. Salaries are low for most people, housing prices are still going through the roof. Crypto won't safe us. Wealthy people will get more wealthy at the cost of others, and some might get lucky..the lucky few who are in it early and take other peoples money when they finally cash out.\\n\\nSorry for the rant, but this is kind of how I'm starting to feel about the whole thing.</td>\n",

       "12   Unpopular opinion: crypto sucks, criticism topic\\nPERSPECTIVE\\nBanks suck but crypto aint much better. Higly speculative and unstable. Just as much bullshit as there is on wallstreet. Leverage, shorting, futures, longs, market manipulation and what not. People gambling with their money.\\n\\nYour keys arn't really safe, what do you want to do, implement a chip in your arm? What if the chip breaks? Keep it digitally somewhere? Dig a hole in the ground? Most people keep it on centralised exchanges anyway. What if you die, it won't go to your relatives?\\n\\nIt fucks with your mental and emotional state too, because of the unstable nature of it. One day you think you have money, the next day 20% is gone. People who buy early are basicly just taking other peoples investment when they sell. Call it pyramid games. The space is flooding with scammers, annoying shilling shouting idiots and and what not.\\n\\nBitcoin and the likes are highly energy inefficient. Yes but look at the regular financial systems energy use you will say, blah blah....this is like saying u can dump your plastic in the river because there's a plastic soup already in the ocean. Yes here and there they use solar panels...well why not use them for more usefull things as they are costly to make. Yes but proof of stake you will say, yes...it's basicly being kept in the air by people that are again....gambling with their money. All these company's, can't they just build stuff without thousands of people throwing their money at them, hoping they will get rich temselves.\\n\\nBlockchains are cool in their decentralised way, but all the speculation on top of it...\\n\\nWhile everyone is shouting at digital coins, society remains a shithole. Salaries are low for most people, housing prices are still going through the roof. Crypto won't safe us. Wealthy people will get more wealthy at the cost of others, and some might get lucky..the lucky few who are in it early and take other peoples money when they finally cash out.\\n\\nSorry for the rant, but this is kind of how I'm starting to feel about the whole thing.   \n",

Like governance tokens - don't need those if no crypto. Proctopcs where you can lend crypto, so others can borrow crypto, so they can ... Buy crypto.\\n\\nIt's a nearly fully self-referential and closed loop system. I real,Ed that, got ros of all ambitions and dreams about it, and just be a cold blooded trader. It helped.   \n",

(source) - ie this game is an entire additional country of environmental damage for ~no useful gain\\nno one has found an actual use for any of it except for online drug dealing (which requires niche coins since Bitcoin is massive distributed public ledger)\\nthe level of market manipulation and accounting fraud by eg Tether (and now USD \"coin\" admitted lying about the backing) would normally send people to jail but has for some reason got a free pass\\nthe clueless marketing by fanboys who only hope to enrich themselves by creating another layer to the pyramid\\nthe endlessly stupid projects it has spawned where blockchain is seen as a solution to anything aside from the niche case of \"distributed tamper evident journal\"\\nit has single handedly made mass international ransomware a viable business model by allowing a way to receive cash outside the banking system\\nthe general enablement of all sorts of scams, e.g. the endless kids on this very subreddit promoting \"12% crypto savings accounts\"\\nIt isn\\'t nearly as secure as people think it is. Any determined state actor could subvert the network.\\nDeflation isn\\'t actually a good thing in a currency. It ultimately favours the wealthy who can hold and dont need to spend.\\nMining (proof of stake or work) allow the wealthy to invest in mining equipment to control or dominate the market.\\nUltimately, no government on earth is going to give up its monetary policy as that is a key lever of control.\\nessentially everyone involved at this point is just trying to hustle the next generation - any hope any of it would serve as a useful technological or financial system has gone)\\nthe massive mis-represnetaion of how bitcoin in particular works, despite claims, it does not offer any of the following:\\nanonymity - the entire blockchain is public and diligently recorded on millions of nodes\\ndistributed freedom - a small number of mining cartels control almost all the hash power and normal people use one of ten crypto currency exchanges for everything anyway\\nunencumbered transactions - it\\'s comically slow and inefficient\\nconvenient purchases - wallets are unwieldly for normal people, no reversibility\\nstore of value - volatility is hilarious and all anyone cares about us BTC:USD\\nthings I do like about cryptocurrency:\\n\\nmonero is pretty clever\\nethereum smart contracts are pretty scifi\\nwatching people learn 5000 years of history of why we have banking regulation in a single decade has been fun\\nthere will be some massive financial catastrophes to watch that will mostly only harm people who did not read my previous list\\nthe earlier state of every single exchange either getting robbed or exit scamming their own fanboys was quite funny in retrospect\\n(thx to u/TwentyCharactersShor for some extra items).\\n\\nI used to just think cryptocurrency was a fun hack but a bad idea for the mainstream, but I\\'m now pretty convinced it should be banned purely on resource grounds, since it seems impossible to force the externalities to be addressed\\n\\nIt\\'s possible that someone will invent a cryptocurrency that\\'s efficient to a level that it\\'s not morally reprehensible to use, but how would it take off? the existing cryptocurrency interests want bitcoin to succeed purely because they\\'re the top of the pyramid and also selling the shovels and so now anything new has to compete aginst the real financial sector and the entrenched cryptocurrency players.'\n",
