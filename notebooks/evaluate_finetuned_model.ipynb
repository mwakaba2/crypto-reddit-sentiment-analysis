Staking and also how the bank's are screwing us over all. The. Fucking. Time. In many generations! So for me crypto is a way to try to get economically independent from the bank's. Why would I keep my money in the bank's, so they have more money to play with, so they can become richer, and they gives me nothing back? Fuck them!!! Before i entered crypto I'dspend money on 'useless' things... Now I think twice before spending... I am very humble and thankfully to this sub. Thanks guys!\\n\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>I used to despise Bitcoin Cash, now I don't and actually see the value in it. This is why:\\nPOLITICS\\nI used to think that Bitcoin Cash was a traitor and to be avoided at all costs. I thought, how can anyone trust an ecosystem if Bitcoin, the #1 coin that everyone holds and believes in ends up being dethroned? Why would anyone invest in this space if King BTC is no more? These were my thoughts in 2017 up until just the other day...\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, I have come to terms that BCH is not just a copy and paste clone of Bitcoin. Every single Bitcoin holder on the planet received an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash because it was a forked from Bitcoin. This means that even if Bitcoin Cash became the #1 cryptocurrency, that Bitcoin holders have no one to blame but themselves if they don't own an equal portion of Bitcoin Cash... it was given to them for free! I guess the more and more I have thought about it, Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin because it has the same previous transaction history and literally everyone holding Bitcoin received an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash, this was no money grab.\\n\\nBitcoin may or may not scale with its small blocksize. We should be thanking Bitcoin Cash for being created to give a counter argument to see if increasing the blocksize ends up being good for scalability and fees. And if it ends up being the #1 cryptocurrency because of this, who cares, everyone holding Bitcoin during the time of the fork holds an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash, and if they don't, then that is on them.\\n\\n\\n\\nNot sure why it took me 3 years to have this epiphany, but I did and wanted to share.

All of things are components of its price and value. People buy, sell and hold for different reasons. You can’t look at it and say “why is it dropping due to inflation, it’s a hedge against inflation.” Also you can’t say it’s a hedge against central banks, because monetary policy and central banks is in probably one of the worst spots it’s been in a while.

It's compared more to the function of gold in relation to gold being the foundation and beginning of Fiat.\\n\\nFiat was created because it was easier to transact with than literally gold. Gold became a denominator of the value of fiat. The problem is that through corruption and human error there is no longer any way to verify the supply of fiat and gold (printing fiat and mixing gold with other things and bad bookkeeping)\\n\\nThen there's Bitcoin. Imagine the same story but instead of gold, fiat being backed by BTC. A verifiable, limited, infinitely divisible asset that is mined through proof of work (like gold)\\n\\nBitcoin is also easier to transact with directly compared to literal gold. This is why people consider it as a possible currency.\\n\\nIf the gold/fiat supply was trusted, then you also wouldn't transact with your precious gold. That's what fiat is for. Same with BTC. Hold BTC, spend fiat.\\n\\nTruth is Bitcoin is many things. Store of value, digital energy (because unusable electricity can be used to mine Bitcoin) transactable medium (currency), a collectible (because it's limited and supply gets lower everytime somebody loses their BTC wallet keys)\\n\\nBTC beats gold. BTC beats fiat. Its more scarce than gold, easy to transfer across the world, non-corruptible, decentralized, verifiable.\\n\\nIt's an alternative to our current Fiat/gold standard, and the only missing component is adoption.   \n",

Either gold or Bitcoin will become the global reserve currency in such a situation, the warning of it happening has been there since 2009. Having a bit of bitcoin and some gold is just good risk management in case that eventuates.

Those volatile stocks were among the largest market cap. They were the darlings of the pandemic. Companies like Netflix, PayPal, Meta, etc, aren't your random companies. They are in the S&P 500 and used to hold major shares in your common ETFs. These aren't some random outliers. When you look at the once top performers, that is not cherry-picking.\\n\\nThe people who are overleveraged in crypto are the same ones doing leverage in stocks. I don't understand why people want to single out crypto. A lot of volatility comes from overleveraged trading. The same suspects are driving the dump in both asset classes. Why deny that?   \n",

       "446  \"Technologically best\" is not a great standard. Whatever blockchain you identify as \"best tech\" can just be literally copied or forked, and the new chain with 0 track record is equally technically good.\\n\\nHaving said that, best for what? There are different blockchains that have some feature that distinguishes them from the rest, and if that feature is the standard, they'd be the best. Should everybody abandon whatever the top blockchain is every time a new project comes out that is \"better\"?\\n\\nETH is good. It was the first to do what it does, has a large number of qualified developers, and lots of nodes. As you say, cheaper, faster, etc. blockchains are now out there--but what's that to all the dApps built on ETH? There's a lot of inertia and human effort tied up in ETH smart contracts. And what if another new generation comes out next year even faster, smarter, cheaper, etc? Or should we go with L2s? Or chains cross-compatible with other chains? Or focus on bridges?\\n\\nIn the end, ETHs value has a lot to do with being first. It has a track record. Millions have found it reliable. Hackers have had at it. Legal jurisdictions have tolerated it. Any clone has a lesser track record. People are more inclined to trust such a blockchain than something shiny and new where they'd have to research the premine and inflation and developers and see if there are any new vulnerabilities that snuck into the code.\\n\\nBitcoin for money and Ethereum for computing do pretty good against the basic requirements for money or computing. People like using what everybody uses. Other chains may end up displacing BTC and ETH, but thousands have tried and failed--it won't be simply because something with better tech, speed, etc. came along.   \n",

While I fully understand it's risky AF, I strongly believe it will be profitable in the long run.\\n\\n   \n",

Staking and also how the bank's are screwing us over all. The. Fucking. Time. In many generations! So for me crypto is a way to try to get economically independent from the bank's. Why would I keep my money in the bank's, so they have more money to play with, so they can become richer, and they gives me nothing back? Fuck them!!! Before i entered crypto I'dspend money on 'useless' things... Now I think twice before spending... I am very humble and thankfully to this sub. Thanks guys!\\n\\n   \n",

I’d spread it though… 25% at 0.05, 25% at 0.04, 25% at 0.03 and 25% at 0.02…\\n\\nAs bearish as that sounds, I believe it will survive a true crypto winter that many alts won’t..   \n",
       "527                                                                                                     I used to despise Bitcoin Cash, now I don't and actually see the value in it. This is why:\\nPOLITICS\\nI used to think that Bitcoin Cash was a traitor and to be avoided at all costs. I thought, how can anyone trust an ecosystem if Bitcoin, the #1 coin that everyone holds and believes in ends up being dethroned? Why would anyone invest in this space if King BTC is no more? These were my thoughts in 2017 up until just the other day...\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, I have come to terms that BCH is not just a copy and paste clone of Bitcoin. Every single Bitcoin holder on the planet received an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash because it was a forked from Bitcoin. This means that even if Bitcoin Cash became the #1 cryptocurrency, that Bitcoin holders have no one to blame but themselves if they don't own an equal portion of Bitcoin Cash... it was given to them for free! I guess the more and more I have thought about it, Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin because it has the same previous transaction history and literally everyone holding Bitcoin received an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash, this was no money grab.\\n\\nBitcoin may or may not scale with its small blocksize. We should be thanking Bitcoin Cash for being created to give a counter argument to see if increasing the blocksize ends up being good for scalability and fees. And if it ends up being the #1 cryptocurrency because of this, who cares, everyone holding Bitcoin during the time of the fork holds an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash, and if they don't, then that is on them.\\n\\n\\n\\nNot sure why it took me 3 years to have this epiphany, but I did and wanted to share. What are your thoughts on Bitcoin Cash?   \n",

Used to throw 50% of my paychecks into crypto from 2018-2020. No one believed that I went from 5k to my name to 500k in crypto at the all time high. You dont need to believe in math, it just works people. Anyway, I quit my job in 2020 and I wish you can soon as well.   \n",

       "433  A lot has changed, actually. There’s hundreds of crypto coins now, and they’re all competitive with each other. Most do more or less the same thing with a different name. That’s a huge dilution of the customer pool. On top of that, given that there are sports arenas named after crypto and multiple Super Bowl ads, it’s likely that crypto has reached nearly every possible customer, so I wouldn’t expect much future growth of the userbase. And the vast majority of customers are looking for investment returns, which have .. not been good, lately. That’s not great for customer retention. On top of that, running the miners, exchanges and ad campaigns are an enormous ongoing cost that customers need to cover in perpetuity. Without some huge growth in the user base, it’s hard to imagine things will get better from here.   \n",
