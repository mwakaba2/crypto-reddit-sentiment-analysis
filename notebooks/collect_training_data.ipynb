       "Hi Shibes,\\n\\nWelcome to todays Daily Discussion post. **YOU ARE DOGECOIN!**\\n\\n---\\n\\nI've received a message from a very helpful shibe who wanted to make sure you're all aware just how important it is to keep your coins safe. \\n\\nLots of people could be storing their coins within apps on their phones (without a way to recover if their phone is broken) or even on an exchange. Both these methods can increase your chances of losing your coins. \\n\\nIf you are holding for a long time you really need to store your coins in an offline manner. Yes, away from the internet and other people. There are many different ways to do this. A lot of people like to use a purpose built hardware wallet like a ledger. Others who might be a little more technically inclined would use a wallet on their computer and extract their private keys. Some do this via websites but be very careful as there are many scam websites out there. \\n\\nIf you know of other ways please discuss in the comments. Please also be aware of random people who might try to steal your keys and thus your coins. You need to really think critically about this to stay safe. \\n\\nHere are two links that explain within them how to safely backup your coins to store them offline. If you know of other posts please link them in the comments and I can add them to an upcoming post. \\n\\n1.  [The Ultimate Simple Guide for Buying, Trading and Storing Dogecoin ](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/mso3z0/the_ultimate_simple_guide_for_buying_trading_and/)  \\n2. [How to create and redeem a paper wallet.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/r7cg2e/guide_how_to_create_and_redeem_paper_wallets/)  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nAlso I just want to quickly remind people that this subreddit does have a tipbot where you can give each other dogecoins.   \\n\\n-->> [Click on this link for instructions on how to start a tipbot account](https://www.reddit.com/r/sodogetip/wiki/index) <<---  \\n\\nOnce you sign up you will get an on-chain wallet address where you can track your coins. You can also get the private key for this wallet from the SoDogeTip website. You can transfer dogecoins into this wallet address and begin giving dogecoin to other people on reddit! And using your key you can also send coins yourself, even if the tipbot is down\\nMaybe you see a meme that made you laugh? Give them a few dogecoin.\\nMaybe you see an insightful post that helped you understand something better? Give them a few dogecoin.\\nMaybe you see a charity you'd like to donate to. Do it with sodogetip. \\n\\nYou can also get the latest version of the dogecoin wallet (version  1.14.5) from www.dogecoin.com \\n\\n---\\n\\nHere are some links and topics that people have wanted me to post here.
